## Messaging App Project
Rather than re-invent the wheel, UNSW has decided that it finds the functionality of **<a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-au/">Slack</a>** to be nearly exactly what it needs. For this reason, UNSW has contracted out Lit Pty Ltd (a small software business run by Hayden) to build the new product. In UNSW's attempt to connect with the younger and more "hip" generation that fell in love with flickr, Tumblr, etc, they would like to call the new UNSW-based product **slackr**.
Beside the information available in the interface that Sally and Bob provided, you have been told (so far) that the features of slackr that UNSW would like to see implemented include:

1. Ability to login, register if not registered, and log out
2. Ability to reset password if forgotten it
3. Ability to see a list of channels
4. Ability to create a channel, join a channel, invite someone else to a channel, and leave a channel
5. Within a channel, ability to view all messages, view the members of the channel, and the details of the channel
6. Within a channel, ability to send a message now, or to send a message at a specified time in the future
7. Within a channel, ability to edit, remove, pin, unpin, react, or unreact to a message
8. Ability to view user anyone's user profile, and modify a user's own profile (name, email, handle, and profile photo)
9. Ability to search for messages based on a search string
10. Ability to modify a user's privileges: (MEMBER, OWNER)
11. Ability to begin a "standup", which is an X minute period where users can send messages that at the end of the period will automatically be collated and summarised to all users
